                            <p>Worked on and maintained a production Department of Defense wide application to inventory software, hardware, and network configurations on clients managed by HBSS. The tool would report these configurations to one of many McAfee ePO servers where our extension would analyze and apply benchmarks to determine whether the configurations were within security standards.</p>

                            <p>Developed HBSS based extension to manage clients integrating the Ambush Intrusion Protection System (IPS). The application would allow HBSS administrators to develop and manage signatures based on code API calls, allow them to create a policy for collections of signatures to look for, and push those policies down to the Ambush clients on the managed assets. The client would then enforce the new policy and alert on any malicious activity on the system, sending events back to the ePO server for analysis.</p>

                            <p>Redesigned a legacy thick client application into a modern web application. The application was a dual purpose system for tracking hardware and software inventory and licenses within the organization as well as a generic ticketing system for any changes in the organization, from software bugs and new features to new fiber drops, to support their Change Management System.</p>

                            <p>Created a thick client application for assisting analysis of unstructured and semi-structured data. This application would take streams of documents or emails; apply natural language processing (NLP), using LCC’s Cicero Server, to determine people, places, things, and their relationships; prioritize the documents that were more important on a per user basis; allow viewing and editing of the entities and relationships; and facilitate correlation of the data to their production database by analysts.</p>

                            <p>Worked on a Java/GWT web application that integrated with C/C++ clients to monitor for advanced persistent threats on the network. The web application would allow administrators to deploy clients down to machines on the network, issue commands to the clients remotely, process the status of the clients in real-time, collect the results from the clients and warehouse the data for future analysis.</p>

                            <p>Researched and developed a GWT/SmartGWT web application for mission planning. The application allowed management to enter their mission statements, desired effects, limitations, and concerns. Analysts could then enter their courses of action (COAs), their corresponding measures of effectiveness (MOE), and estimates on the effectiveness of those COAs. They could then view a tree graph of the desired effects, apply COAs to the effects on the graph, and change the weights of the COAs (depicting which they deem more important) and could visually determine effectiveness towards a desired effect by the change in color scale(shades from green to red). Once they determined they COA they wanted to implement, they could choose that one in the next steps and create a report for the mission plan which would also provide feedback once the effectiveness was truly measured.</p>

                            <p>Researched and developed medical record system for mobile applications. The application was a research project to demonstrate the capabilities of mobile devices as room to room inputs for doctors.</p>

                            <p>Created a web application for displaying and analyzing open source data using emerging technologies in information extraction and Natural Language Processing. The web application allowed users to view the data in multiple ways such as traditional table structures and visual graphs of links and nodes.</p><br>
